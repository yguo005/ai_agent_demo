Of course. Here is a practical, phased workflow to implement your "Intelligent Incident Response & Remediation Agent" for the hackathon. This plan prioritizes getting a demonstrable Minimum Viable Product (MVP) quickly and then layering on the intelligence and sponsor tools.

Phase 0: Setup and Scaffolding (The First 2-3 Hours)
Goal: Create the basic structure, install dependencies, and get API keys.

Environment Setup:
Initialize a Git repository: git init
Create a Python virtual environment: python -m venv venv and source venv/bin/activate
Create a requirements.txt file with all necessary libraries:
code

content_copy

expand_less
anthropic
llama-index
honeyhive
redis
requests  # For mocking Speakeasy/Qodo API calls
streamlit # For a simple UI
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Sponsor Tool Access:
Sign up for free/trial accounts for Anthropic, HoneyHive, and Redis (e.g., Redis Cloud).
Get your API keys for each service and store them securely (e.g., in a .env file).
Project Structure:
Create the main files for your agents and services.

Phase 1: The Core Plumbing (MVP Workflow)
Goal: Make the agents pass a simple message from one to the next using Redis as the "Pacer." No AI involved yet.

Simulate Threat Data:
In simulated_data.py, create Python dictionaries for your demo triggers (one from Horizon3.ai, one from Bright Data).
Implement the Pacer (pacer.py):
Write simple functions to connect to your Redis instance.
Create a publish(channel, message) function and a subscribe(channel) function. This will be the communication backbone.
Code the "Dumb" Agents:
agent_monitor.py: Write a function detect_threat() that loads a simulated JSON object from simulated_data.py and publishes it to a Redis channel named threat-raw.
agent_analyzer.py: Write a function analyze_threat() that subscribes to the threat-raw channel. When it receives a message, it simply prints it and publishes a placeholder message like {"status": "analyzed", "remediation": "block_ip"} to a new channel called threat-analyzed.
agent_orchestrator.py: Write a function remediate_threat() that subscribes to the threat-analyzed channel and prints the message it receives.
Tie it Together (main.py):
Write a script that starts the analyze_threat and remediate_threat agents in listening mode (e.g., running their subscribe loops).
Then, call detect_threat() to kick off the workflow.
Checkpoint: When you run main.py, you should see console output showing the message being passed from the Monitor to the Analyzer and finally to the Orchestrator. The core A2A communication is now working.

Phase 2: Adding Intelligence (Context Engineering)
Goal: Integrate Anthropic and LlamaIndex to transform raw data into actionable context.

Build the Knowledge Base:
In knowledge_base.md, add simple information your agent can use for context.

# Company Asset Inventory
- The server at IP 10.1.10.55 is 'srv-finance-01'.
- 'srv-finance-01' is a critical asset owned by the Finance department.
- It processes quarterly earnings reports and contains employee PII.
- The system owner is Alice. Her contact is alice@yourcompany.com.
Integrate LlamaIndex:
In agent_analyzer.py, use LlamaIndex to load and index knowledge_base.md. Create a query engine from this index.
Integrate Anthropic:
Now, supercharge agent_analyzer.py.
When it receives the raw threat from Redis, it will not just pass it along. Instead, it will:
a. Use the LlamaIndex query engine to ask questions based on the raw data (e.g., "What do you know about the asset with IP 10.1.10.55?").
b. Construct a detailed prompt for Anthropic's Claude. This is the key to your demo.
Example Prompt:
```
You are a world-class security analyst AI. Your task is to transform raw technical threat data into actionable business context.

Here is the raw threat data:
{raw_threat_json}

Here is what our internal knowledge base says about the assets involved:
{llama_index_query_result}

Based on all this information, provide a summary in the following JSON format:
{
  "summary": "A human-readable summary of the threat and its business impact.",
  "severity_justification": "Explain why this is high, medium, or low severity.",
  "recommended_action": "A clear, single action to take (e.g., 'isolate_host', 'reset_credentials').",
  "notification_message": "A friendly message to post in the #security-alerts Slack channel."
}
```
c. Call the Anthropic API with this prompt.
d. Publish the resulting JSON from Anthropic to the threat-analyzed Redis channel.
Checkpoint: The message received by your Orchestrator agent should now be a rich, structured JSON object generated by the AI, not a simple placeholder.

Phase 3: Closing the Loop and Polishing for the Demo
Goal: Implement the final action step, add observability with HoneyHive, and build a simple UI.

Implement Remediation:
In agent_orchestrator.py, parse the JSON it receives from the analyzer.
Based on the recommended_action field, perform a simulated action.
Example: If the action is isolate_host, make a requests.post() call to a dummy URL like https://api.firewall.yourcompany.com/block or simply print a very clear, formatted message:
[ACTION] Remediation Orchestrator is calling the Firewall API to isolate host 10.1.10.55.
Integrate HoneyHive (The Controller):
In agent_analyzer.py, wrap your Anthropic API call with the HoneyHive SDK.
Use honeyhive.log() to capture the prompt, the response from Claude, and any other useful metadata (like latency or the raw threat data).
This allows you to log the entire decision-making process, making your agent observable and continuously improvable, fulfilling the MCP requirement.
Build the Demo UI (app.py):
Use Streamlit to create a dead-simple interface.
Add a title: "Intelligent Incident Response Agent Demo"
Add a button: "Inject Critical Vulnerability Threat"
When the button is clicked, it triggers your detect_threat() function from agent_monitor.py.
Add text areas that update in real-time (or near-real-time) by listening to the Redis channels, showing:
Raw Threat Detected: (Displays the initial JSON)
AI Analysis & Context: (Displays the rich output from Anthropic)
Remediation Action Taken: (Displays the final action from the Orchestrator)
This workflow takes you from a blank folder to a fully functional, impressive demo that perfectly matches the hackathon challenge statement.
